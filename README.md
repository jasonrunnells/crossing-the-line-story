# Crossing the Line

This project investigates the relationship between commercial vessel activity and protected marine zones within the Channel Islands region. Using over a year of Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracking data, it analyzes the movements of Island Packers vesselsâ€”official concessionaires for Channel Islands National Parkâ€”and how often their routes intersect with boundaries of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) and Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

The interactive web experience presents maps, statistics, and narrative content to explore how tourism overlaps with zones meant to protect fragile marine ecosystems. Each vesselâ€™s behavior is individually visualized and compared, offering insight into spatial trends and operational impact.

## ðŸŒŠ Key Questions

- Where do Island Packersâ€™ vessels travel within the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary?
- How frequently do their trips enter Marine Protected Areas, and how does this vary by vessel?
